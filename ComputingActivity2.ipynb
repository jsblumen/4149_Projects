    "Previously, you would use tables in the back of a book to look up the properties of fluids. That will become cumbersome if you you have to find fluid properties several times when analyzing a system, so we will use an open source tool to help us. Cantera is a suite of software tools for problems involving thermodynamics. Cantera will allow you to determine fluid properties. You can use Cantera from Python or Matlab. In this activity, we will use Python.\n",

For example, if you know the temperature and pressure of a gas entering a device, Cantera will allow you to easily \"look up\" other properties like enthalpy and entropy at that state. \n",
